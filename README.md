# Answers Question 1 -5 
1. *Extract predicates and arguments based on the dependency structure. Describe how you did this. Please note: Your approach is not going to be able to capture all predicates. If you have time left, you can replace your rule-based approach with a machine-learning-based approach.*


2. *Describe the classification task for argument classification. (You can decide whether you want to do this in one or in two steps.) Use your own words to describe what the classification instance is. You can refer to the background document for help.*

3. *Make a list of features to extract (including but not limited to the syntactic dependency features extracted in Assignment 1). Add at least one lexical feature to your syntactic features (e.g. lemma, word embeddings). Describe all your features and explain why you chose them. You can check the literature in order to find out more about the features. You can also invent features yourself. Note: If you don’t manage to implement some of your features, please still include them in your list, but add a short comment stating that they are not implemented).*

4. *Select a machine learning algorithm. You can select any algorithm and use existing implementations (such as sklearn), but please motivate briefly why you chose it. A possible motivation is that it has been shown to work well in existing approaches (based on literature you read).*

5. *Generate training and test instances*
